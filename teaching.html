        <h2 id='teaching-statement'>Teaching Statement</h2>

        <div id='teaching-statement-bg' class='rounded'>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> I remember when I first started programming. The near-instant
                gratification of putting simple code into a
                file and seeing the output on my computer screen made me excited to learn more. However, I also remember
                the
                frustration of spending hours in a computer lab on a program that turned out different than I expected.
                Now,
                as an educator, it is my hope to show students the joys of technology while demonstrating to them how to
                deal with its frustrations. I want my students to know that anyone, including them, can learn to
                program. At
                the same time though, I want them to know that learning to program requires time and they do not need to
                know everything right away.</p>

            <p>My methods for helping students to achieve these goals include: authentic tasks, allowing them to connect
                assignments to their self-interests, project-based outcomes, and timely feedback. As a professional
                software developer with +10
                years of experience, I remember having to often solve issues that I had not previously encountered
                before.
                This required me to prototype possible solutions before fully implementing them. Using that same line of
                thought, I ask my students to complete assignments that resemble authentic tasks in that they require
                them
                to apply new knowledge to somewhat ill-defined problems. This requires students to plan and explore how
                they
                will complete a given assignment without any type of specific blueprint. Tasks like this require that I
                properly sequence content and limit the scope of each so as to not overwhelm individuals.</p>

            <p>A closely related idea related to authentic tasks is the idea of allowing students to connect assignments
                to
                their self-interests. I believe computing education can be hard for many students to learn, if they are
                asked to complete assignments that do not connect to their self-interests. Problems without a context
                that
                students find interesting may lead them to think certain content areas are uninteresting and
                unimportant. If
                you want someone to have an interest in something, it is easier if you can connect to their own
                self-interests. When I design assignments, I try to make them open-ended enough to allow students some
                freedom in choosing the content of the assignment. By having influence in the context of their work,
                students can engage with domains they find more relative. One example of this type of assignment is the
                mobile-friendly self-introduction website I ask students in my first web programming class to create.
                That
                assignment has a general set of criteria that students are responsible for, but the content is of their
                choosing.</p>

            <p>Complementary to the ideas of authentic tasks and connecting assignments to self-interests is
                project-based outcomes.
                I believe the best way to understand if students are learning and if my teaching is effective is to use
                project-based outcomes. Once students have the opportunity to start developing a conceptual
                understanding of
                how a specific technology works, I believe project-based outcomes are a strong method for summatively
                assessing student understanding. Projects can be designed to measure cumulative understanding of a
                technology, since students have the opportunity to use multiple features of that technology in context.
                Another advantage of project-based outcomes is that it allows students to connect technology to personal
                interests not possible in many other assessment methods. An example of this type of work is the mobile
                narrative project in my first semester web-programming course. Students are asked to tell a story about
                something important to them using the tools we cover in class from the web programming ecosystem. By
                assessing students' understanding using these methods, I will be able to properly adjust my teaching as
                needed.</p>

            <p>The previous mentioned ideas are at their best when I provide timely feedback. When students complete an
                assignment, I want them to know what they excelled at and what they
                could improve upon with constructive feedback. I try to deliver in a timely fashion, so that students
                can
                use the feedback in their next assignment(s).</p>

            <p>My ultimate goal as an educator is to put individuals in a place where they are able to be successful
                whether
                that be inside of the classroom or at the workplace after graduation. My experiences in programming,
                researching how to measure student understanding, and guiding others how to use technology makes me an
                effective educator for teaching others about technology. I know students are people and that they each
                come
                to class with different academic backgrounds and knowledge. I strive to meet students at their level of
                understanding and guide them until they can start working independently using their own initiative.

                            Design Table). From there, I develop sub-learning outcomes, course activities and

                            associated activities is sequenced to properly scaffold student understanding (see GIMM 260

                            assessment is to provide quick feedback to students, so they can utilize it for programming

                            mobile-responsive websites. In GIMM 260 (see GIMM 260 Syllabus), this means learning the
                            basics of how to design a website (HTML & CSS) and the basics of how to use a database
                            (Node.js & MySQL). The context for these skills is how to use a website to present a
                            data-driven narrative. Student work that displays these learning objectives include a
                            website about the bad manners some players display in different online video games and how
                            fast different players can complete the original Nintendo game Castlevania. For GIMM 285
                            (see GIMM 285 Syllabus), students expand their web development skills by learning to design
                            web-based forms, extend their knowledge of how to use a database, and how to combine both of

                            and size of the class, my students' schedule, and their purpose for being in the GIMM major.
                            First, all of my courses in GIMM are taught in a computer lab with a maximum of 30 students.
                            When designing my courses, I try to design activities that would only be possible in that
                            specific environment (e.g. group programming in GIMM 260 and 285 syllabus) Second, related
                            to students' schedules, I do not penalize last work. I do not know all of the factors in
                            their life that may impact their ability to complete work, so I accept all homework until
                            the final week before finals. This can be seen in the GIMM 260, GIMM 285, and GIMM 440
                            syllabus. Lastly, another factor I reflect when teaching is what is the reason why a student
                            is in my course. Students in GIMM have various interests ranging from programming to art to
                            game design. Due to these various interests and the fact that my courses have learning
                            outcomes related to programming, I design my coursework to allow students to connect work to
                            their own interests when possible. An example of this can be seen in the GIMM 260 Mobile
                            Narrative Project (part 1) where students need to develop a web narrative about a topic of
                            their choice.</td>

                            Table and Syllabus) is given to students in three forms in this order: weekly formative
                            in-class group activity, weekly formative individual programming activity, and summative
                            individual project. Weekly in-class group activities allow me to introduce class content in
                            a low-stakes environment to students where they have the chance to practice what they
                            learned with their peers. Out-of-class assignments are another low-stakes environment for
                            students as I make it a point to give feedback on each of these. After those opportunities
                            to practice what they learn, students are finally assessed using individual projects. The
                            order of these activities is shown in the GIMM 260 Syllabus.

                            To overcome these I frequently use EBIPs such as pair-programming, contextualized computing,
                            and collaborative learning to address these. Pair-programming is when two or more
                            individuals focus on a specific coding task together at the same time (this is in contrast
                            to something like divide-and-conquer work style). This EBIP also helps to show students
                            programming is a social activity as compared to an individual one. Closely related is
                            collaborative learning. When students work together, they often have better retention of
                            knowledge (constructivism). Lastly, contextualized computing allows students to connect
                            programming content to their interests by allowing them to code about something they are
                            interested in. Examples of these EBIPs can be seen in GIMM 260 In-class Activity: Responsive

                            design a web narrative about a topic of their choice. Lastly, part of the criteria asks them
                            to incorporate feedback from the first hand-in as means of improving upon previous work.

                            rely on two primary methods. First, I allow students to select what context they complete
                            their assignments and projects for. For example, for the GIMM 260 Mobile Narrative Project
                            (part 1), I allow students to select the story they want to tell with their narrative and
                            only have hard requirements on the technical aspects. Similarly for the GIMM 285 In-class
                            Activity: Forms, I allow students to create an HTML form for the topic of their choice with
                            only requirements on the more technical aspects. The other method I use to make learning
                            activities more engaging is by having students complete tasks that mirror what real web
                            developers (e.g. redesign an existing website (GIMM 260 Mobile Friendly Self-Introduction
                            Website) and incorporate client feedback into a project (GIMM 260 Mobile Narrative Project
                            (Part 2)).

                            First, all of my courses have a late work policy that allows all work to be accepted up

                            semester in order to talk with them and to learn more about them (e.g. GIMM 260:

                            including: self-reflection on my current practices, prior experience as a student, my
                            current students, and the knowledge of other researchers. First, I participate in
                            professional development opportunities like the one for developing this portfolio to be
                            self-reflective of my practice and improve my teaching. Second, my prior experience as a
                            student has taught me that it is important that students be able to select the context of
                            their work when learning computing. I have had classes in the past that taught computing
                            very abstractly. This was not only boring to me, but also hard to connect to the larger
                            application of computing. This is why I use contextual learning and let students select the
                            topics for their programming assignments (e.g GIMM 260 Mobile Narrative Project (part 1),
                            GIMM 285 In-class Activity: Forms, GIMM 260 Mobile Friendly Self-Introduction Website).
                            Third, students and their work can tell me if the way I taught something worked or not. For
                            example, during my spring 2022 GIMM 285 course, I noticed multiple students were repeatedly
                            late in completing assignments related to SQL (database programming language). After
                            noticing this, I updated the schedule to allow more time for this topic in class (seen in
                            GIMM 285 Syballus). Fourth, I try to follow and incorporate the research of educational
                            researchers. The two main avenues I follow and practice are constructivistism and contextual
                            learning. Constructivistism lends itself to more active learning (e.g GIMM 285 In-class
                            Activity: Forms) while contextual learning lends itself to students selecting their topics
                            when completing assignments and making the content more personal (e.g. GIMM 260 Mobile
                            Narrative Project (part 1), GIMM 260 Mobile Friendly Self-Introduction Website). Lastly, I
                            take advantage of the resources offered by the Boise State University's Center for Teaching
                            and Learning to inform the status of my courses. For example, during my Fall 2022, I asked
                            for a Midsemester Assessment Program (MAP) for my new GIMM 340 course (see Fall 2022 - GIMM
                            340 Midsemester Assessment Program). Based on the feedback, I removed the 2nd project from
                            my course in order to better focus on the earlier topics taught in the course.</td>

                            (e.g. ethics). I want to diversify the type of assessments I use in order to have even
                            stronger evidence that the way I am teaching is really working (Results From Research -
                            Future). I want to incorporate more non-technical issues into my computing courses, because
                            it is important that students are aware of the power and influence computing has in today's
                            world. In order to meet these goals I plan on developing a concept inventory around the
                            broader idea of client - server computing and then making it available for public use and
                            continuing to attend different professional development activities to improve my ability to
                            teach about non-technical issues in my computing courses.

                            things my fall 2021 students thought I did well were my timely feedback and how coursework
                            built on previous content. One thing students I said I could improve on would be the way
                            AJAX / Node.js were taught in class (Fall 2021 - GIMM 260 Student Evaluations). In my fall
